# Full optimal binary search trees: research record

Started 2026-10-18, America/Chicago. Research and exposition by OpenAI Codex
Sydney, with sponsorship and problem selection by the repository owner.

## Objective and status

Find a substantively useful improvement for the full optimal binary search tree
problem, or prove an appropriate barrier to subquadratic construction. The
general exact subquadratic problem remains unresolved by this project.
The current checkpoint gives exact sufficient contraction rules and an
adaptive linear preprocessing pass. Its bound is O(n+m^2+sum k_t^2), where
m is the surviving core size and k_t are independently solved block sizes.
This improves state counts substantially on a seeded heavy-separator input,
but little on ordinary random mixed weights. Novelty is unestablished;
no general subquadratic bound or complexity lower bound is claimed.

Input: ordered keys 1..n, key weights p[1..n], gap weights q[0..n], all
nonnegative. No normalization is required. Use comparison cost with root key
cost one and gap cost equal to the number of internal ancestors. In half-open
key intervals [i,j),

    C(i,i) = 0
    W(i,j) = sum(p[i:j]) + sum(q[i:j+1])
    C(i,j) = W(i,j) + min_r(C(i,r) + C(r+1,j)), i <= r < j.

The common convention charging one additional unit at every gap differs by
sum(q), independent of tree shape.

  additive height excess. Sequential key placement uses a bit-vector state
  for the occupied right-fringe levels. Relevant to near-uniform inputs;
  this representation is existing work, not a novel proposal here.

## Research directions to discriminate

User steering: primary measurements are visited interval states, candidate
roots, and all preprocessing/bound work. Include geometric, reversed geometric,
folded geometric, near-uniform, random, zeros/ties, and mixed key/gap inputs.
An improvement must avoid most of the interval table in its claimed regime.

1. Sparse optimality certificates / demand-driven exact DP: can many interval
   states be excluded by certified lower bounds without losing exactness?
2. A representation of mixed key/gap cost that permits an efficient relaxation
   with a verifiable gap. Preserve key termination; do not silently convert to
   the alphabetic special case.
3. Rotation-based or stronger local certificates: find exact small
   counterexamples before investing in claims of sufficiency.
4. Compressed interval DP and structural parameterization: identify which
   parameters actually bound work, and compare with Larmore's existing method.

## Completion requirements

- A fully stated, proved result or substantively validated algorithm for the
  requested mixed-weight problem, with honest scope and prior-art comparison.
- Reproducible correctness and adversarial evidence; practical claims require
  appropriate matched benchmarks against Knuth and relevant alternatives.
- TeX manuscript and compiled, visually checked PDF uploaded to papers_please.
- Continued pursuit of the full objective; intermediate notes are not completion.
